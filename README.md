Symfony2 + ESI + Nginx + php-fpm + APC + Varnish
======================

This is a basic setup for above configuration that works on a server
with 1 core and 1GB of RAM.

Folders imitate default installation paths for Linux Debian OS.
Files don't contain full configuration, rather the relevant parts you need to change/add.

Specific versions that this setup was tested on:
Symfony 2.1-RC1
Nginx   1.2.3
PHP     5.3.15
Varnish 2.1.3
